# Project: Student Grading and Data Processing

## Description
This project was completed as part of my practice in learning the Python programming language. During this work, I mastered fundamental concepts such as conditional statements, loops, exception handling, and working with arrays.

## Tasks
The project includes the following tasks:

1. **Student Grading**: The program prompts the user for their exam score and outputs a grade based on the result. It then checks whether the score is above or below the average score (70).

2. **Grading with `match...case`**: This task is similar to the first, but it uses the new `match...case` construct to determine the grade.

3. **Counting Vowels and Consonants**: The program counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given word.

4. **Sum of Numbers**: The program prompts the user for numbers and sums them until the user enters 0.

5. **City Travel**: The program creates a tuple with city names and outputs them in a specified order.

6. **Working with Arrays**: The program performs operations on an array, including calculating the average value, adding, and removing elements.

7. **Exception Handling**: The program prompts the user for two numbers and outputs the result of their division, handling possible errors such as division by zero and invalid input.
